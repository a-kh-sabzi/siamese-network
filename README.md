# siamese-network

## Introduction

This project implements a siamese network that takes two characters as input and outputs a similarity score between 0 and 1. The output 0 means that the two input characters are completely different and output 1 means that they are exactly the same.

## Data set

This neural network was trained and tested on Omniglot data set for one-shot learning that can be found at:
